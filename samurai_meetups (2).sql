In the beginning, tea was served like Mat-Cha. Japanese Tea Ceremony represented by Sen no Rikyū, was established at around 1600. The production process of “Sen-Cha”, the most popular type of tea in currently, was created around 1800s.

Made from tea leaves whose enzyme is deactivated as soon as picked up.<br/>\n- Half fermented: ”Oolong tea(烏龍茶)”,”Blue tea(青茶)”,”Dark tea(黒茶)”<br/>\nEnzyme is activated half way.<br/>\n- Fermented tea: “Darjeeling ”,”Assam”,”Uva”<br/>\nVery brown.

Tea produced in mountain has strong smell and sharp bitterness. On the other hand, tea produced in flat land has clear bitterness and blue color of nature.<br/>\n⑥Sen-Cha from Sashima, Ibaraki(茨城県猿島)<br/>\nThe land is flat yet very cold. This climate creates a big gap of temperature, which helps to produce a good tea.

Today, we participated to Making Edo-Furin class coordinated by Yoshiharu Shinohara, the leading person of the Edo-Furin! <br/>\n　 <br/>\n<b>〓SAMURAI INTERVIEW : Yoshihara Shinohara(篠原儀治), the Edo-Furin Instructor〓</b><br/>\n　<br/>\n●Please tell us about history of Edo-Furin.<br/>\nーFurin had been a luxury item in the old time, but at the later Edo period, Furin became well known among general Japanese people. During the Edo period, Furin had only been used by “Daimyo”, top officials of local governments or by wealthy merchants of this era, who called furin “Fukoto”. “Fukoto” means the Japanese harp Koto automatically making beautiful sounds by natural wind. <br/>\n　<br/>\nPeople in the Edo period had been thinking how to enjoy the hot weather in the summer, and as a result, they made Edo-Furin. Edo-Furin made many people feel very comfortable, so there is a comic Tanka, or poem, called “Kyoka”. “No voices of Furin sellers, but many customers there; that is a virtue of Furin”. As beautiful sounds came from Furin, Furin sellers needed to say nothing to advertise it, an uncommon scene of this era. <br/>\n　<br/>\nFurin was originated from China. In the old time of China, people did a fortune-telling via making sounds by hitting jewels each other, while in Japan, this fortune-telling evolved into making Furin. <br/>\n　<br/>\n●How to make Edo-Furin?<br/>\nーLet you know the making process of Edo-Furin.<br/>\n① Take up the hot glass.<br/>\n② Inflate the glass like a 5oo yen coin.<br/>\n③ Take up glass again. This glass is the body of Furin.<br/>\n④ Put in a little bit air. And make a hole by using wire for threading.<br/>\n⑤ At last, inflate the body quickly.<br/>\n⑥ Cut off the portion of the 500 yen by knife. And make the jaggy portion.<br/>\n⑦ Draw whatever you want to design inside of glass.<br/>\n⑧ After dried it, insert a string between glass holes to ring it as a bell.<br/>\n　<br/>\n●What is the most important thing you would like to tell everyone?<br/>\nー"Edo-Furin" made of glass is more colourful and comfortable in sound as compared with a bell made of iron one. Various kinds of glass wind bells resonate and are in harmony and change in sound as wind blows. It is our sincere hope that you could enjoy the delightful sounds of "Edo-Furin" and the bell would be kept carefully in your home for many and many years to come.<br/>\n　<br/>\n<b>〓PARTICIPANTS'' VOICE〓</b><br/>\n"It was wonderful time for me.

People who went to saunas (called “Furo” in the old days) laid out a cloth that they used to wrap their change of clothes. In the Edo era, when distribution was developed, Furoshiki was convenient because they could wrap and carry lots of different things and it was easily carried when they were done using it. In this tour, we participated in the Furoshiki class coordinated by Junko Tsutsumi, the Furoshiki coordinator!<br/>\n　<br/>\n<b>〓SAMURAI INTERVIEW : Junko Tsutsumi(つつみ純子), the Furoshiki coordinator!〓</b><br/>\n　<br/>\n●Why is the way of counting Furoshiki called “Haba(巾)”?<br/>\nーA profession called weaver was the sphere of work of many women in the old days. The width of Furoshiki became the same size as the average Japanese woman’s waist! This was because it was too difficult for weavers to move their arms either too wide or too narrow for long periods of time. Since then, we count Furoshiki by using “Haba(巾).”<br/>\n　<br/>\n●What is the meaning of the Furoshiki pattern?<br/>\nーFor example...<br/>\n1. The flax ornament pattern refers to the prosperity of descendants, because they grow straight and fast.<br/>\n2. The foliage scrolls pattern is a symbol of viability. They look like ivy growing more and more. That pattern was popular in the Edo era, because people felt uncomfortable if the pattern was off-center.<br/>\n　<br/>\n●What are some good points of using Furoshiki?<br/>\nーOf course a bag is convenient for carry something regular sized.<br/>\nBut Furoshiki has various uses, for example wrapping gifts, wine or smartphones, or as a substitute for an eco-bag. They are more convenient in this way.<br/>\n　<br/>\nAnd if you know the wrapping method and the meaning of the pattern, you also know spirit of word and hospitality in good ol’ Japan!!<br/>\n　<br/>\n<b>〓PARTICIPANT'' VOICE〓</b><br/>\n”Alex and I enjoyed learning so much about long yet very rich history woven into furoshiki! We had fun during the workshop session too, we even wished we had a longer time practicing other ways of using furoshiki. Alex seemed very grateful how he got to listen to the lecture both in Japanese and English, even for Japanese participants, I can see how bilingual lectures would be educational and interesting.

It aims to give you freedom (I''m assuming “自弓” was actually supposed to be 自由 not 自弓）as a human through hard work. And It aims to increase the self control you have. Also. it aims to cultivate compassion, respect, and peace in your heart. Aikido represents the spiritual culture and tradition of Japan.

In Japan, if you''re not drinking Japanese whisky, Japanese beer, or the miracle of chuhai – you''re probably drinking sake.<br/> Today, Kaori Isono taught us how do different Sake taste on Japanese Sake tasting class at 豆松カフェ!<br/><br/><br/>〓SAMURAI INTERVIEW : Kaori Isono (磯野カオリ), the sake sommelier and the owner of 横浜 桜酒亭（osaketei）〓<br/><br/>■What''s the origin of "Sake"?<br/>ーThe history of the rice wine is old and it is recorded from 5000 BC. Sake began to be made during the Yayoi period (500-1000 BC) and rice growing became more common. Formerly, it was a holy drink to give to God in hopes of a good rice harvest. <br/>It was derived from malted rice brought from China in the Nara era (700s). In the beginning, Japanese sake was called “Kuchi Kami no Sake.” People of that era chewed rice, let sake be fermented and made it with saliva. <br/>It was the basic way of the current style of how to make sake. As for Shochu, the production techniques came from China in the Azuchimomoyama era (1500s).<br/><br/>■How to make "Sake"?<br/>ーSake is a brewed alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice but few people know how it is actually made. Since rice does not contain any sugar, it cannot be fermented as is. <br/>It has to first be converted into sugar with the help of enzymes found in a particular mold called koji-kin. The resulting koji is then added to yeast known as kobo and left to ferment.<br/> Due to using advanced production methods, are performed glycation and fermentation at the same time, the ability of the master brewer is involved heavily in the quality of Japanese sake.<br/><br/>■What kind of Sake are we tasting today?<br/>ー【1】“Chobitto Kanpai ちょびっと乾杯” (Strawberry, Blueberry, Citron, Mellon) made in Shizuoka prefecture. Its taste is like liqueur.<br/> This is Sparkling Sake with each fruits puree. Those fruits made in Shizuoka prefecture also. *The alcohol content : 6% *Choose one flavor for cheers!!<br/>【2】Junmai Ginjo Genshu “Rikishi 力士” made in Saitama prefecture. This Sake has a rich and brightness taste with a sharper finish. (Genshu: sake without added water.) *The alcohol content : 17% *Rice Polishing rate : 55％<br/>【3】Special Junmai unfiltered Kizake “Azakura 阿桜” (2types) made in Akita prefecture. <br/>You can enjoy good combination of sweetness and acidity. (Kizake: raw sake, no heat-processed.) \r\n*The alcohol content : 16% *Rice Polishing rate : 60％<br/>【4】Unfiltered Junmai “Hakurosuishu 白露垂珠” made in Yamagata prefecture. Feel unique throat comfort...creamy and slightly sparkling. (This classifies Nigori: unrefined sake.) *The alcohol content : 14.5% *Rice Polishing rate : steamed rice 65% and Jacqui rice 60%<br/><br/>〓PARTICIPANT'' VOICE〓<br/>Today''s sake tasting was great, now I know what real sake tastes like ;) <br/>The owner Kaori Isono is really an expert of what comes to sake!

The first is the character for ''tree'' - pronounced here as moku. The second has a basic meaning of ''board'' (or ''plate'' as in ''printing plate''), pronounced han.<br/> Here though, they are combined with kan, which our dictionaries tell us carries the meanings of ''mansion'' or ''hall'', and which in practice is a character appearing at the end of a compound word indicating the place associated with the object/action. <br/>So coming after mokuhan, it will imply that this is the place where we will find woodblocks!<br/><br/><br/>〓PARTICIPANT'' VOICE〓<br/>"It was such a great tour ever i had before!

He learned when he was a child and always found it a positive effect in his life. So we would like to experience Zen and learn to love it the way he did.<br/> The purpose of this tour was to introduce Zen to others to inspire them to learn more about Zen and Japanese traditional culture with Kiyohiko Shimazu, the representative Director of Zentrepreneur Association! <br/><br/><br/>〓SAMURAI INTERVIEW : Kiyohiko Shimazu (島津清彦), the representative director of Zentrepreneur Association 〓<br/><br/>●What is "Zen" ?<br/>ー"Zen" is the basic concept of buddhism. Zen meditation offers you many benefits, because it<br/>1. releases your stress<br/>2. Increases your concentration <br/>3. makes you relaxed and more compassionate <br/>Japanese cultures, such as Japanese garden, Japanese Calligraphy, Tea Cult and New print art are deeply connected to ZEN spirit.<br/><br/>●Where can i practice "Zen" ?<br/>ーYou can meditate not only in the Japanese style room but also everywhere you want.<br/> You don''t need to cross your legs, just close your eyes and breathe deeply. For example, you can practice Zen on commuter train in the morning.<br/><br/><br/>〓PARTICIPANT'' VOICE〓<br/>”Regarding the tour, it was amasing experience. We have an opportunity to see and try things which weren''t normally available. The Zen tour was perfectly planned and we had opportunity to gain overview of Japanese culture.<br/> I would like to know even more and more information but unfortunately the day has only 24hours. Anyway, it was worth to join Samurai meetups :)”<br/><br/><br/>〓PLACE INFORMATION〓<br/>●<a href="http://teien.tokyo-park.or.jp/en/hama-rikyu/">Hamarikyu Gardens(浜離宮恩賜庭園)</a><br/>●<a hred="http://www.tsukiji.or.jp/english/">Tsukiji fish market(築地市場)</a><br/>●<a href="http://www.hangasw.com">渡邊木版美術画舗</a>', 2, '2016-09-14 09:26:08');
