Today, we participated to Making Edo-Furin class coordinated by Yoshiharu Shinohara, the leading person of the Edo-Furin! <br/>\n　 <br/>\n<b>〓SAMURAI INTERVIEW : Yoshihara Shinohara(篠原儀治), the Edo-Furin Instructor〓</b><br/>\n　<br/>\n●Please tell us about history of Edo-Furin.<br/>\nーFurin had been a luxury item in the old time, but at the later Edo period, Furin became well known among general Japanese people. During the Edo period, Furin had only been used by “Daimyo”, top officials of local governments or by wealthy merchants of this era, who called furin “Fukoto”. “Fukoto” means the Japanese harp Koto automatically making beautiful sounds by natural wind. <br/>\n　<br/>\nPeople in the Edo period had been thinking how to enjoy the hot weather in the summer, and as a result, they made Edo-Furin. Edo-Furin made many people feel very comfortable, so there is a comic Tanka, or poem, called “Kyoka”. “No voices of Furin sellers, but many customers there; that is a virtue of Furin”. As beautiful sounds came from Furin, Furin sellers needed to say nothing to advertise it, an uncommon scene of this era. <br/>\n　<br/>\nFurin was originated from China. In the old time of China, people did a fortune-telling via making sounds by hitting jewels each other, while in Japan, this fortune-telling evolved into making Furin. <br/>\n　<br/>\n●How to make Edo-Furin?<br/>\nーLet you know the making process of Edo-Furin.<br/>\n① Take up the hot glass.<br/>\n② Inflate the glass like a 5oo yen coin.<br/>\n③ Take up glass again. This glass is the body of Furin.<br/>\n④ Put in a little bit air. And make a hole by using wire for threading.<br/>\n⑤ At last, inflate the body quickly.<br/>\n⑥ Cut off the portion of the 500 yen by knife. And make the jaggy portion.<br/>\n⑦ Draw whatever you want to design inside of glass.<br/>\n⑧ After dried it, insert a string between glass holes to ring it as a bell.<br/>\n　<br/>\n●What is the most important thing you would like to tell everyone?<br/>\nー"Edo-Furin" made of glass is more colourful and comfortable in sound as compared with a bell made of iron one. Various kinds of glass wind bells resonate and are in harmony and change in sound as wind blows. It is our sincere hope that you could enjoy the delightful sounds of "Edo-Furin" and the bell would be kept carefully in your home for many and many years to come.<br/>\n　<br/>\n<b>〓PARTICIPANTS'' VOICE〓</b><br/>\n"It was wonderful time for me.

In the Edo era, when distribution was developed, Furoshiki was convenient because they could wrap and carry lots of different things and it was easily carried when they were done using it. In this tour, we participated in the Furoshiki class coordinated by Junko Tsutsumi, the Furoshiki coordinator!<br/>\n　<br/>\n<b>〓SAMURAI INTERVIEW : Junko Tsutsumi(つつみ純子), the Furoshiki coordinator!〓</b><br/>\n　<br/>\n●Why is the way of counting Furoshiki called “Haba(巾)”?<br/>\nーA profession called weaver was the sphere of work of many women in the old days. The width of Furoshiki became the same size as the average Japanese woman’s waist! This was because it was too difficult for weavers to move their arms either too wide or too narrow for long periods of time. Since then, we count Furoshiki by using “Haba(巾).”<br/>\n　<br/>\n●What is the meaning of the Furoshiki pattern?<br/>\nーFor example...<br/>\n1. The flax ornament pattern refers to the prosperity of descendants, because they grow straight and fast.<br/>\n2. The foliage scrolls pattern is a symbol of viability. They look like ivy growing more and more. That pattern was popular in the Edo era, because people felt uncomfortable if the pattern was off-center.<br/>\n　<br/>\n●What are some good points of using Furoshiki?<br/>\nーOf course a bag is convenient for carry something regular sized.<br/>\nBut Furoshiki has various uses, for example wrapping gifts, wine or smartphones, or as a substitute for an eco-bag. They are more convenient in this way.<br/>\n　<br/>\nAnd if you know the wrapping method and the meaning of the pattern, you also know spirit of word and hospitality in good ol’ Japan!!<br/>\n　<br/>\n<b>〓PARTICIPANT'' VOICE〓</b><br/>\n”Alex and I enjoyed learning so much about long yet very rich history woven into furoshiki! We had fun during the workshop session too, we even wished we had a longer time practicing other ways of using furoshiki. Alex seemed very grateful how he got to listen to the lecture both in Japanese and English, even for Japanese participants, I can see how bilingual lectures would be educational and interesting. We appreciate how samurai meet-ups focus on learning something new from what we''ve always seen as "old"! We would love to join upcoming events from samurai san and expand our network!”<br/>\n　<br/>\n<b>〓PLACE INFORMATION〓</b><br/>\n●Furoshikible<br/>\nhttp://www.furoshikible.com <br/>', '2016-08-15 11:40:19'),

Later being promoted to the younger generation. In 1984, Yamashita from Japan and Mohammed from Egypt fought in the final of the L.A. Olympics. Even though Yamashita had injured his leg in the previous match, Mohammed never attacked Yamashita’s injured leg. This conduct represents the spirit of Bu-do.<br/>\nToday, we participated the Aikido(合気道: one of the Bu-do) class coordinated by Katsuhiko Tanaka(田中勝比古), the professional of Aikido!<br/>\n　<br/>\n<b>〓SAMURAI INTERVIEW : Katsuhiko Tanaka(田中勝比古), the professional of Aikido and founder of Tanaka Jyuku〓</b><br/>\n　<br/>\n●What is Aikido?<br/>\nーAikido is not a fighting sport to compete with someone for the sake of strength. It aims to give you freedom (I''m assuming “自弓” was actually supposed to be 自由 not 自弓）as a human through hard work. And It aims to increase the self control you have. Also. it aims to cultivate compassion, respect, and peace in your heart. Aikido represents the spiritual culture and tradition of Japan. Aikido shares the same values as Europe culture, which is known for its fine arts and chivalry, in a point of achieving harmony and activation in heart. Achieving harmony and activation in heart means to get harmonized with Chi(気) of universe.<br/>\n　<br/>\n●How to sit in Seiza(正座)?<br/>\nーLet you know how to have Seiza, Japanese traditional sitting style.<br/>\n1. Place your toe over the other toe and Keep distance between your knees as wide as two fists<br/>\n2. Calm your mind<br/>\n3. Stretch your back straight<br/>\n4. Get your upper half relaxed<br/>\n　<br/>\n●What''s the purpose of Aikido breathing and how can we do it?<br/>\nーThe purpose of Aikido breathing is to feel as if you are a part of the sky and ground, nature and the universe. And to create an active and healthy body and mind through interaction with sky, ground and nature.<br/>\n- How:<br/>\n1.Close your eyes, open your mouth a bit, exhale gently while saying “Haa”<br/>\n2.When you exhale, think about the sensations of your head, breast, stomach, feet and toe<br/>\n3.Inhale from your nose<br/>\n4.Focus on your toe, feet, stomach, breast and head in order<br/>\n- Tips:<br/>\n・Imagine as if bad things are leaving your body<br/>\n・Imagine as if you are in middle of nature (a forest, a pasture, etc)<br/>\n・When you do it by yourself, do it in large free area<br/>\n・You can do it not only by sitting but also standing, sleeping and even walking<br/>\n・Bu-do starts and ends with a bow<br/>\n　<br/>\n<b>〓PARTICIPANT'' VOICE〓</b><br/>\n”I enjoyed the Samurai Meetups a lot. The other guys and the instructor were so nice. We had a lot of fun and got a really interesting introduction in the history of Aikido. It was exhausting but at the end we did some really relaxed breathing exercises. When I''m back in Germany i will definitely look for lessons to learn more Aikido.
