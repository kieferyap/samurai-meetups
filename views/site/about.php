        “SAMURAI MEETUPS” was launched with the strong desire to serve people who have always loved the Japanese culture but has never had the chance to experience it. We offer tours that will allow you to journey across the vast ocean that is Japanese culture as it is experienced by the locals through activities like Calligraphy, Tea Ceremonies, Japanese Cuisine, and others, taught by professionals from each field. Instead of just imagining what it would be like, come, and experience first-hand the true Japanese spirit as no foreigner has ever experienced before!

	<ul>
		<li>Pictures of that beautifully presented cuisine, that perfectly sculptured garden, that sacred shrine emitting a divine radiance, taken during your visit in Japan could be even further enriched with knowledge of their story that lay in the background?</li>
		<li>Baffled about why things are done or presented a certain way at a certain time but do not possess the articulacy in the local language to express it?</li>
		<li>You’ve always wanted to experience first-hand the true Japanese culture as felt by the locals but have never gotten the chance to?</li>
	</ul>
